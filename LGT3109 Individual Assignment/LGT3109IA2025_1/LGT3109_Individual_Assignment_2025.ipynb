    "### Part 1: Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** You are required to extract information from a webpage of the Hong Kong Airport at https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/airlines-information/airlines.page and to create a table of airline information in an Excel worksheet. The figure below provides a preview of some airlines' information presented in the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'fig1.png' width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Excel worksheet is required to have a title “Airline Information”, together with four columns presenting information of airlines' names,  codes, aisles, and phone numbers for general enquiries. The figure below presents a preview of some rows of the table to be created.\n",
    "<img src = 'fig2.png' width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A pure manual approach:** You can create the table of airline information by the following steps:\n",
    "1.\tCreate a new Excel file airline_info.xlsx, and add the title and the headers of the four columns to an Excel worksheet for the airline information\n",
    "2.\tOpen the browser Chrome to visit the airline information webpage at https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/airlines-information/airlines.page\n",
    "3.\tFor each airline shown on the web page, \n",
    "    - (a)\tcopy its name and paste it to the column A of the Excel sheet\n",
    "    - (b)\tcopy its code and paste it to the column B of the Excel sheet\n",
    "    - (c)\tcopy its aisle and paste it to the column C of the Excel sheet\n",
    "    - (d)\tcopy its phone number for genreal enquiries and paste it to the column D of the Excel sheet\n",
    "4.\tAdjust the format of the worksheet, including column widths, fonts, etc. Save the Excel file of the airline information\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the pure manual approach above involves lots of manual tasks, and thus is very boring and time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** To enhance the approach for making the airline information table, your need to apply your Python coding skills to automate the process."

    "### Part 2 (Compulsory): Automation of Data Extraction Column by Column\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of copying and pasting data to the worksheet cell by cell, we can automate data extraction and then copy-paste extracted data to the worksheet column by column.  This can significantly reduce the copying and pasting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the improved approach has the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a new Excel file named \"airline_info.xlsx\", and add the title and headers of the four columns to a worksheet for the airline information\n",
    "2. Open the Chrome browser to visit the webpage of the Hong Kong Airport at https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/airlines-information/airlines.page\n",

    "4. (Task 2.2) Extract-Copy-Paste Airlines' names:\n",
    "    - (a) Execute a code to extract airlines' names from \"airline_info.tx\"t and print them line by line\n",
    "    - (b) Copy and paste all the airlines' names together to the column A of the Excel sheet\n",
    "5. (Task 2.3) Extract-Copy-Paste Airlines' codes:\n",
    "    - (a) Execute a code to extract airlines' codes from \"airline_info.txt\" and print them line by line\n",
    "    - (b) Copy and paste all the airlines' codes together to the column B of the Excel sheet\n",
    "6. (Task 2.4) Extract-Copy-Paste Airlines' aisles:\n",
    "    - (a) Execute a code to extract airlines' aisles from \"airline_info.txt\" and print them line by line\n",
    "    - (b) Copy and paste all the airlines' aisles together to the column C of the Excel sheet\n",
    "7. (Task 2.5) Extract-Copy-Paste Airlines' phone numbers for general enquries:\n",
    "    - (a) Execute a code to extract airlines' phone numbers for general enquries from \"airlines_info.txt\" and print them line by line\n",
    "    - (b) Copy and paste all the airlines' phone numbers for general enquries together to the column D of the Excel sheet\n",
    "8. (Task 2.6) Adjust the format of the worksheet, including column widths, fonts, etc. Save the Excel file \"airline_info.xlsx\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the approach, you need to complete the following tasks 2.1-2.6. Before starting these tasks, make sure to follow Step 1 mentioned above to create a new Excel file named \"airline_info.xlsx\". Additionally, follow Step 2 to open the airline information webpage in the Chrome browser. </font>\n",
